    <h2>KNOW ABOUT RAJSHAHI</h2>
    <p>Rajshahi (Bengali: রাজশাহী, [radʒ.ʃaɦi]) is a metropolitan city and a major urban, administrative, commercial and educational centre of Bangladesh. It is also the administrative seat of the eponymous division and district. Located on the north bank of the Padma River, near the Bangladesh–India border, the city is surrounded by the satellite towns of Nowhata and Katakhali, which together build an urban agglomeration of about 1 million population.[4][5] It is the most environmentally friendly city in Bangladesh.[6][7] Modern Rajshahi lies in the ancient region of Pundravardhana. The foundation of the city dates to 1634, according to epigraphic records at the mausoleum of Sufi saint Shah Makhdum. The area hosted a Dutch settlement in the 18th century.[8] The Rajshahi municipality was constituted during the British Raj in 1876. It was the divisional 
        capital of the greater Rajshahi division which was the largest division in Bengal Province.</p>
